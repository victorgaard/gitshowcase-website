        Back in 2017, my friend Pedro and I embarked on a journey to make it
        easier for developers to showcase their work with GitShowcase ‚Äî a
        platform that turned GitHub repos into a beautiful portfolio in minutes.
      </p>
      <p>Over the years, GitShowcase grew beyond our expectations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          ‚ú® Featured as the <Link
            href="https://www.producthunt.com/products/git-showcase#gitshowcase"
            >4th Product of the Day on Product Hunt</Link
          >
        </li>
        <li>üöÄ 150k+ projects showcased by developers around the world</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Today, we've decided to step away from actively maintaining GitShowcase
        as our focus shifts to other exciting endeavors. This wasn't an easy
        decision, but we're incredibly proud of what we've achieved together
        with your support.
      </p>
      <p>
        A heartfelt thank you to everyone who joined us on this journey ‚Äî
        whether you built a portfolio, shared feedback, or cheered us on. We
        couldn't have done it without you. ‚ù§Ô∏è
